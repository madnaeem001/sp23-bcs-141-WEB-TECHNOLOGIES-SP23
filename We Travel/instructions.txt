## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Folder Structure
```
your-project-repo/
│
├── midtermlab/
│   └── resumecv.html
│
├── css/
│   └── style.css (EXISTING - ADD NEW CSS TO THIS)
│
├── images/
│   └── retina-travel.png
│
└── [other files]
```

### Step 2: Add CSS to Your Existing style.css
Copy all the content from **cv-styles.css** and paste it into your existing **css/style.css** file at the end (after all your existing styles). This ensures all CV styling is applied.

```css
/* Existing styles from your project... */

/* ============================================================
   CV PAGE STYLES - Add these to your existing style.css
   ============================================================ */

/* Copy all styles from cv-styles.css here */
```

### Step 3: Update Your Navigation Menu
In your header section (used in other pages), add a link to the CV page:

```html
<li><a href="resumecv.html">CV</a></li>
```

or for the midtermlab folder:

```html
<li><a href="./midtermlab/resumecv.html">CV</a></li>
```

### Step 4: Customize Content
Edit the following content in **resumecv.html**:

1. **Personal Information Section**
   - Replace "Your Full Name" with your actual name
   - Update email address
   - Update phone number
   - Update location

2. **Education Section**

- Icons and badges scale up on hover
- Experience cards slide right on hover
- All transitions are smooth (0.3s - 0.4s duration)

### Color Scheme

- Dark Text: `#1a3a52` (Navy Blue)
- Secondary Text: `#5a7a8d` (Medium Blue-Gray)

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Styles not showing?**
A: Make sure you added the CV styles to your existing `style.css` file in the `css/` folder.

**Q: Header/Footer looks different?**
A: Adjust the header and footer paths if your project structure is different. The paths should match your existing project setup.

**Q: Sections not expanding?**
A: Ensure the JavaScript in the HTML file is active (check browser console for errors). Also verify Font Awesome CDN is loading.

**Q: Icons not showing?**
A: Check browser console - Font Awesome CDN link might be blocked. Consider replacing with unicode characters if needed.

## Customization Tips

### Change Color Scheme
In your `style.css`, find and replace:
- `#b9cbe6` with your primary color
- `#1a3a52` with your text color
- `#5a7a8d` with your secondary text color

### Adjust Animation Speed
Find `transition: ` properties and change the duration (e.g., `0.3s` to `0.5s`)

### Modify Spacing
Change `padding`, `margin`, and `gap` values to adjust spacing between elements

### Add More Sections
Duplicate a section div and change the class names and content accordingly
